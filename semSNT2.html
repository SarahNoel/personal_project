	<p>So what does life hold for me after gSchool?</p>

</header>

  <p> How do I feel about starting this adventure? Excited and nervous. <br> I've been in a comfortable career and this is a giant step.<br>  It's a good step, but a slightly scary one.  I'd say I feel like unto this poor chap here:<br><br><br> </p>

<p><br><br>Poor cats, the laughingstock of the interwebs.</p>
<p>See, I'm excited, like I want to dance, but the I start thinking about what's to come and I start to panic. <br> Said dance becomes more awkward than it began, and I end up just side hopping across the floor. </p>

<p>You guys feel me, or am I alone in this?</p>

<p>Ah-hem.  Well, this is awkward.</p>

<p>Anyway!  So here's what's to come!</p>

<section id="future">

	<p>With my background in education, I hope to use this new skill set in that realm.  Technology and the internet are the future of education, and the surface has just been scratched.  The potential for what can be accomplished in the world of education is immeasurable.  I hope to get involved with creating apps for the classroom, improved school websites, a better gradebook and/or ways for communicating with parents.  As a teacher with firsthand experience, I think this is somewhere I can thrive and find fulfillment and purpose in my work.  I may even enter the classroom again and go back into teaching and help kids expand their potential even more.  Theyâ€™re the future, right?  The long and the short of it is that I want to work in education and help those punk kids that I love. </p>
