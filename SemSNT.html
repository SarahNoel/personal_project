<h2> Backstory </h2>

    <p> On a cold winter night of 1986, I entered this world. It was a relatively easy journey, or so they tell me.  </p>

    <p> Oh, too far back?  My bad. </p>

    <p> I grew up in the beautiful state of Colorado, and have been in Utah since I graduated high school<br> in 2005.  In April 2012, I graduated from <a href="http://home.byu.edu/home/"> Brigham Young University </a> with a degree in Secondary Spanish <br>Teaching and a minor in TESOL.  From there I spent the last three years teaching <br>7th and 8th graders Spanish at <a href = "http://www.2summit.org/"> Summit Academy Jr High </a> in Draper, Utah. <br> It was a magical adventure, but now it's time to start something new and <br> perhaps make enough to move out of my parents' basement.  <br><br>Perhaps. </p>

<p> So how did I get the way I am?  I'd give credit to these people.</p>

<p> This is my family.  They're pretty cool.</p>

<p>These are the parentals, Scott and Susan.  But we affectionately call them Bell and Gorge. <br> It's not weird, I promise.  </p>

<p>I'm the second child of four.  <br>I was raised alongside three crazy brothers, Steven, Shawn and Seth. <br> Yes, we're all S names. No, I don't plan on continuing the tradition.</p>

  <p>So now I'm off the gSchool to learn some things! <br>  Would you like to know what I want to do with this sick new set of skills?<br>  Follow the prancing dinosaur to find the way... </p>
